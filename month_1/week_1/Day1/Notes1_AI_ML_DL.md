# Day 1 - What Is AI, ML, DL?
AI => Artificial Intelligence => Technology that makes computers act intelligently: Reasoning, problem-solving, perception...
Examples:
- Chess program that plans moves.
- Chatbot that answers questions.
- A self-driving car that makes decisions.

AI is the broad field: Any system that behaves "smartly," even if rule-based.

ML => Machine LEarning => Let computers learn from examples, not rules.
Example:
### Classical rules:
```python
if hours_studied > 5:
    grade = "A"
elif hours_studied > 3:
    grade = "B"
else:
    grade = "C"

### ML :
| hours_studied | grade |
| ------------- | ----- |
| 1             | D     |
| 2             | C     |
| 4             | A     |
| 5             | B     |
| ...           | ...   |

ML = Learning patterns from data.
